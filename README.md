# Google-Drive-Stream-Proxy
> Alternative Google Drive Stream Script

The code is re-modified for the users to be able to understand the function of this script. [Click me](https://japnimeserver.com/drive/) if you want to see the demo, use [json parser](http://json.parser.online.fr/) to get the variables correctly.

## Guide and Updates
- From the script, you can fetch the google drive id by this format `fetch.php?id=` (Only the ID itself, not the url).
- You may place the file `stream.php` everywhere, it depends on how you will make it creatively.

### fetch.php updated
```php
$modiapi = 'japnime'; // For your `$api=`
$streamdrtr = 'stream.php'; // For the directory of the `stream.php`, you can change it between domain or file only
```
